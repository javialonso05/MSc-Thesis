# Welcome

This repository corresponds to the code used in the MSc thesis titled "Unsupervised Machine Learning on Astrochemical Spectra - a study on high-mass star-forming regions" written by Javier Alonso Garc√≠a on 2025. The different pre-processing methods and tested models are discussed in 2 Jupyter notebooks: preprocessing.ipynb and modeling.ipynb. 

The results discussed in these notebooks require access to the ALMAGAL data, which is not yet public. If you have access to this data, place the sources.tar file under "Data\Raw\" in the main directory to be able to use the extraction functions written in "src\data". If you have similar data and wish to use these same models, make sure to properly load it and input it into the models as done in the notebooks.
